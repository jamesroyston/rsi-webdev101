    <title>Day 3: JavaScript Basics</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals</h1>
    <p>
        We are going to build ...something... in our script tag that will leverage the fundamentals of JavaScript and programming, generally, within the console. 

        f**k. just got an idea.

        why don't we make day 4 or 5 the day we circle back to the DOM with JavaScript...? 
        
        or should we teach DOM before basics? probably not because we still need to know about the building blocks in order to fully utilize the DOM stuff. glad we had this talk. haha.

            LESSON PLAN FOR TODAY: 

            - data types: strings, numbers, objects (everything     is an object)
            - arrays
            - variables
            - functions
            - loops (maybe, this might come later)
            -
